# CSC 499 Sorting HW - Spring 2021
This is my assignment for Career Preparation. We are to take an input file with a list of names and sort it by length then alphabetically. 
<br />
We are then suppose to commit this to a Github repo.
<br />
Then we must change the code and an argument that reverses the sort and commit that. 
<br />
Instructions for the Junit Testing of the Sorting App:
<br />
You must save your input file onto your desktop. Your desktop is also where your output file location will be. If you would like to use somewhere else, you must update the path location for the string inputFile and outputFile. 
<br />
You must create an expected file on your desktop and the contents must contain the expected outcome you are expecting to receieve.
<br />
You cannot run both tests together since they are both saving in the same location. 
<br />
The first test does not include the reverse while the second test does.
