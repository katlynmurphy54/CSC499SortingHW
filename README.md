# CSC 499 Sorting HW
This is my assignment for Career Preparation. We are to take an input file with a list of names and sort it by length then alphabetically. 
<br />
We are then suppose to commit this to a Github repo.
<br />
Then we must change the code and an argument that reverses the sort and commit that. 
<br />
I have added my files in a zip folder containing all you need to run the project. 
<br /> HW 1 zip is the files just sorting the array by length and alphabetically while HW 2 zip reverses the array and has an updated read me.
